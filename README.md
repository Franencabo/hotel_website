This is first exercise of a HTML & CSS course. 
In this exercise I will create a simple Hotel Website.  I won´t use Flexbox or Grid, because you can read old stuffs like floats, overflow and
whatever that make you crazy in front of your screen. Don´t worry about this!!!!! In next exercises I will use modern CSS, I promise!
